# simple-microservices

An example of building micro-services by .NET Core

![ci](https://github.com/kimcu-on-thenet/simple-microservices/workflows/ci-simple-microservices/badge.svg)

## Business Rules

1. Create a **Inventory** in **Inventories** context => `InventoryId` by using _GraphQL Mutation_
2. Create a **Product** in **ProductCatalog** context => `ProductId` by using _GraphQL Mutation_
    - By using **Domain Event** within **Publish Subscribe Pattern** and Redis Pub/Sub; it's going to create a **Product** in **Inventories** context automatically
4. Assign **Product** to **Inventory** with `Quantity` and `CanPurchase` by using _GraphQL Mutation_
5. Ability to retrieve all products in **ProductCatalog** within the **Inventories** that they've been assigned which can be retrieved from **Inventories** context
    - Since we're developing microservices; the integration must be accomplished by Restful (communicate over HTTP protocol)

## Starting from local with Dapr Cli

### Step 1

```cmd
docker-compose -f docker-compose-dev.yml up -d
```

_To see the logs_

```cmd
docker-compose -f docker-compose-dev.yml logs -f
```

To exit the interactive mode use `Ctrl + C`


### Step 2: Init Dapr

- Follow [this link](https://github.com/dapr/docs/blob/master/getting-started/environment-setup.md#installing-dapr-cli) to install [Dapr](https://dapr.io/)
- Start initializing Dapr

    ```powershell
    Î»  dapr init
    ```

    ```powershell
    Making the jump to hyperspace...
    WARNING: could not delete run data file
    Downloading binaries and setting up components...
    Installing Dapr to c:\dapr
    Success! Dapr is up and running. To get started, go here: https://aka.ms/dapr-getting-started
    ```

### Step 2

#### Starting ProductCatalog Api

    ```powershell
    cd .\src\Services\ProductCatalog\SimpleStore.ProductCatalogApi
    ```

    ```powershell
    dapr run --app-id product-catalog-api --app-port 5001 dotnet run
    ```

#### Starting Inventories Api

    ```powershell
    cd .\src\Services\Inventories\SimpleStore.InventoriesApi
    ```

    ```powershell
    dapr run --app-id inventories-api --app-port 5002 dotnet run
    ```

#### Starting GraphQL Api

    ```powershell
    cd .\src\Services\GraphQL\SimpleStore.GraphQLApi
    ```

    ```powershell
    dapr run --app-id graphql-api --app-port 5000 dotnet run
    ```

### Step 3

- Go to `http://localhost:5000`
- Then use the examples at [Queries and Mutations](QueriesAndMutations.md)

## Cleanup

```powershell
dapr uninstall
```

## Deploy to Kubernetes

- These services can be also deployed to Kubernetes by following [this guide](Helm/README.md)
